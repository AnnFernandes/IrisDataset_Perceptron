# IrisDataset_Perceptron
Nerual Network that implements Perceptron Algorithim from Scratch

Iris data contains the measurements of 3 different species of Iris: Setosa, Versicolour and Virginia.

Each line in the files represents a separate data point where each data point includes the following comma separated values:
Sepal length (cm), Sepal width (cm), Petal length (cm), Petal width (cm), class label
Example: 5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa

Got the best rate â€“ 93.3% using the iteration 1500 and a learning rate of 0.01
